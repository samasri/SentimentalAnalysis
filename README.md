# Sentimental Analysis
Used IBM Watson ToneAnalyzer to analyze the data collected by Coursera on the students of one of its courses to infer how different factors affect student's sentiments.

This project is part of my CMPUT 660 course in the University of Alberta; all gathered results are included in [my final presentation](https://github.com/samasri/SentimentalAnalysis/blob/master/Presentation.pdf) and [final report.pdf](https://github.com/samasri/SentimentalAnalysis/blob/master/Report.pdf)
